# Math Game

Math game where users can pick the difficulty, operations, question count they want. User score is displayed at the end with the option to start over.

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] User can select a difficulty ranging from easy to hard. (easy = numbers < 10, medium = numbers < 25, hard = numbers < 50).
* [ ] User can select different operations for the questions (addition, multiplication, subtraction, division).
* [ ] SafeArgs is used to carry user input/data from fragment to fragment using a navigator for a seamless user experience.

The following **extensions** are implemented:

* SafeArgs
* Fragment
* NavController

## Notes

It was rather difficult to figure out how to use NavController with fragments at first. After I figured out the first one though it was much easier. Additionally, I had trouble with generating the questions according to the user's input as well as using SafeArgs to carry the data from fragment to fragment. Thankfully I was able to figure both issues out.
